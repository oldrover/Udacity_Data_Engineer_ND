# Data Engineer Nanodegree Project: Datamodeling with Postgres

## **Overview**
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

In this project, we apply Data Modeling to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python.


## **Song Dataset**
Songs dataset is a subset of [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/).
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.

This is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.:
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

## **Log Dataset**
Logs dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by [Event Simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim).

This is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like :
```
{"artist": null, "auth": "Logged In", "firstName": "Walter", "gender": "M", "itemInSession": 0, "lastName": "Frye", "length": null, "level": "free", "location": "San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA", "method": "GET","page": "Home", "registration": 1540919166796.0, "sessionId": 38, "song": null, "status": 200, "ts": 1541105830796, "userAgent": "\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"", "userId": "39"}
```


## Schema for Song Play Analysis

#### Fact Table 
**songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`

```
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
```

#### Dimension Tables
**users**  - users in the app
```
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
```
**songs**  - songs in music database
```
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
```
**artists**  - artists in music database
```
artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
```
**time**  - timestamps of records in  **songplays**  broken down into specific units
```
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
```

## Project Files

```sql_queries.py``` -> contains all sql queries for dropping and creating fact and dimension tables and insertion queries

```create_tables.py``` -> drops and creates tables. Run this file to reset your tables before each time you run the ETL scripts

```etl.ipynb``` -> reads and processes files from **song_data** and **log_data** and loads the data to your tables 

```etl.py``` -> reads and processes files from **song_data** and **log_data** and loads the data to your tables

```test.ipynb``` -> displays the first few rows of each table to let you check the database


## How to run

First run the file ```create_tables.py``` and then the file ```etl.py``` to read and process the files from **song_data** and **log_data**
